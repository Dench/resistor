&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These 2 bedroom Limassol beach apartments for sale are considered to be a great investment opportunity.&amp;nbsp;All local amenities are within walking distance and these include restaurants, bars, supermarkets, car hire, banks, and souvenir and tour shops. A regular bus service or a short taxi ride takes you into the heart of the tourist area where restaurants, bars and nightclubs are in abundance. The Limassol Star Beach Village affords privacy and tranquillity and is an ideal base from which to explore the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These exclusive Limassol beach apartments for sale are designed with style and finest architecture, offering an exclusive lifestyle by the beach. The green areas carefully left within the project create stunning landscaping grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The development includes also a Tennis Court, a large adult swimming pool and a kids swimming pool as well, gated and available only to the development's residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ideal Location, this complex is an ideal base from which to explore the island. It is approximately a 1 hour drive to Paphos to the east, Ayia Napa to the west and the Troodos mountains to the north. The Amathus area has undergone major road works during 2001. This is now all complete and has enhanced the beauty and safety of the area. Amathus is one of the ancient city Kingdoms of Cyprus where according to legend, Theseus left the pregnant Ariadne to be taken care of, after his battle with the Minotaur. There was a very important cult of Aphrodite-Astarte here. Excavations are still continuing at the Acropolis and Agora area of the ancient site. Numerous tombs have been found, one of them can be visited in front of the Amathus Beach Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Beach, one of the best Limassol has to offer, is sandy and has been awarded the &amp;lsquo;Blue Flag&amp;rsquo;. The sea is calm, has no undercurrents and is therefore safe for children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;These Limassol beach apartments for sale are located among 5 star deluxe hotels and resorts with sandy organised beaches and watersports with the St Raphael pleasure boat Marina at only 300m away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Transport Car hire is available and can be booked through us at very reasonable rates. However, local buses are regular, inexpensive and available on the main coastal road, as are taxis. Pick up points for all excursions are available within walking distance. We can also arrange for transfers to and from airports at an additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;</longDesc>

		<propertyName>Regina Court 12 - New modern design project in tourist area</propertyName>
		<shortDesc>If there’s something that Regina Court 12 offers, it’s a lifestyle built along luxury living and being designed by one of Cyprus leading developers, you can be assured that every last detail of this project in Limassol’s popular Germassoyia tourist area is a reflection of modern design. </shortDesc>
		<longDesc>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Located in a prime residential area of Limassol, comprising of modern apartments, ranging from 1, 2 and 3 bedroom units, only 5 minutes walk to sandy organised beach and 5 star hotels. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Contemporary architectural design, built to the highest specifications and hi-tec specifications.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Centrally located in one of the most sought-after areas of Limassol and near the famous tourist area.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Gated properties for added privacy and security / Underground parking for all residents.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Large communal swimming pool and children's paddling pool, BBQ and sunbeds area for residents' use only.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Title deeds available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If there&amp;rsquo;s something that Regina Court 12 offers, it&amp;rsquo;s a lifestyle built along luxury living and being designed by one of Cyprus leading developers, you can be assured that every last detail of this project in Limassol&amp;rsquo;s popular Germasoyia&amp;nbsp;tourist area is a reflection of modern design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the electric gate with individual remote controls for added privacy or the provision for light sensors at both the main entrance and the underground parking area with storage facilities, you know you&amp;rsquo;ll be surrounded by modern features from the moment you enter in these Limassol apartments for sale in Regina Court 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Out of seventeen Limassol apartments for sale, you have the option of a studio, one-bedroom apartments, two-bedroom or three-bedroom Penthouses. Whatever size you want, there is one thing that will not be compromised and that is the dedication to detail and quality throughout this project. From the imported EU quality kitchens, wardrobes and internal doors to the safety locks on both the main entrance and sliding doors there is hardly anything that Limassol apartments for sale in Regina Court 12 don't offer as a testament to modern luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Of course, as Cyprus is the sunshine island, it makes sense that this testament is continued to the outside of Regina Court 12 with a communal area dedicated to modern relaxation. Boasting both an adult and children&amp;rsquo;s pool, ample sun bed terraces you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to enjoy the sunshine with taste as the BBQ area has a working area with a basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Naturally the project would have to be in the appropriate location to live up to its quality build and the Germasoyia&amp;nbsp;Tourist area with its proximity to the Limassol tourist region means that you are within walking distance to both sandy beaches as well as restaurants, cafes, bars and even nightclubs. You&amp;rsquo;re also ten minutes from the main town and its shopping regions while living in Limassol means you are central located in Cyprus, with the two international airports of Larnaca and Paphos both just forty minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Whatever the reasons you may be interested in &lt;strong&gt;Limassol apartments for sale&lt;/strong&gt; in Regina Court 12, whether you want to enjoy its testament to modern luxury yourself or whether you&amp;rsquo;re using it as an investment, you know you&amp;rsquo;ve made the right choice as the developer is the only one in Cyprus to have been awarded the prestigious ISO 9001 certification.&lt;/p&gt;</longDesc>
